"""Parallel multi-entity fan-out for the --competitors flag.

The orchestrator accepts a `main_runner()` for the topic and a
`competitor_runner(entity)` for each peer. It parallelizes their execution
via a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and collects per-entity Reports. Per-entity
failures are logged and dropped; the run survives as long as the main topic
plus at least one competitor succeed.

This module owns no business logic about pipeline arguments — the caller
(scripts/last30days.py main) builds the closures with the appropriate
config, depth, and overrides for each entity.
